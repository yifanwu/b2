# B2

B2 is a Jupyter extension that augments your programming experience with interactive visualizations for data analysis. You can find the talk and demo [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWz7R6RI0z8&ab_channel=YifanWu).

**Load dataframes to visualizations in a dashboard area that you can interact with**
